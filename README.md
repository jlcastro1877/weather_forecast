# weather_forecast
This is an application that displays the current temperature, humidity, wind, and date for a city that you choose. 
When you click the "Get Weather" button, the city name is used to call an API to get the latitude and longitude. 
The latitude and longitude are then used to call another API to get the weather data. 
The data is displayed on the UI, and below the main card are 5 cards containing the forecast for the next 5 days. 
Below the Weather Dashboard header are the 5 most recently searched cities.
